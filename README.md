# Monolith

A monolithic container for lazily summoning a language-agnostic Linux
development environment. This is kind of the antithesis of what Docker is
designed for, but sometimes I just use Docker as the fastest means of getting a
Linux development environment running ASAP. Mostly, I'm just tired of finding
that my container is missing a required dependency.
